            <summary>
            This event is raised when fields are requested in a feature source method that do
            not exist in the feature source. It allows you to supplement the data from any outside
            source you have.

            <remarks>
            This event is raised when fields are requested in a feature source method that do
            not exist in the feature source. It allows you to supplement the data from any outside
            source you have.<br/>
            	<br/>
            It is used primarily when you have data relating to a particular feature or set of
            features that is not within source of the data. For example, you may have a shape file
            of the world whose .dbf component describes the area and population of each country.
            Additionally, in an outside SQL Server table, you may also have data about the countries,
            and it is this data that you wish to use for determining how you want to color
            each country.<br/>
            	<br/>
            To integrate this SQL data, you simply create a file name that does not exist in the
            .dbf file.  Whenever Map Suite is queried to return records that specifically require
            this field, the FeatureSource will raise this event and allow you the developer to
            supply the data. In this way, you can query the SQL table and store the
            data in some sort of collection, and then when the event is raised, simply supply that
            data.<br/>
            	<br/>
            As this is an event, it will raise for each feature and field combination requested.
            This means that the event can be raised quite often, and we suggest that you cache the
            data you wish to supply in memory. We recommend against sending out a new SQL query
            each time this event is raised. Image that you are supplementing two columns and your query
            returns 2,000 rows. This means that if you requested those fields, the event would be raised
            4,000 times.

            <summary>
            This event is raised after the CommitTransaction method is called, but before the
            CommitTransactionCore is called.  This allows you access to the TransactionBuffer before the
            transaction is committed. It also allows you to cancel the pending commit of the
            transaction.

            This event is raised before the CommitTransactionCore is called and allows you
            access to the TransactionBuffer before the transaction is committed. It also allows you
            to cancel the pending transaction. The TransactionBuffer is the object that stores all
            of the pending transactions and is accessible through this event to allow you to either
            add, remove or modify transactions.<br/>
            	<br/>
            In the event that you cancel the CommitTransaction method, the transaction remains intact and
            you will still be editing. This makes it a nice place to possibly check for
            connectivity before the TransactionCore code is run, which is where the records are
            actually committed. Calling the RollBackTransaction method is the only way to
            permanently cancel a pending transaction without committing it.

            It is typical that the FeatureSource may be opened and closed may times during the life
            cycle of your application. The type of control the MapEngine is embedded in will dictate
            how often this happens. For example, in the case of the Web Edition, each time
            a FeatureSource is in the Ajax or Post Back part of the page cycle, it will close the
            FeatureSource before returning back to the client. This is to conserve resources, as
            the web is a connection-less environment. In the case of the Desktop Edition, we can
            keep the FeaureSources open, knowing that we can maintain a persistent connection.

            <remarks>
            The live transaction concept means that all of the modifications you perform during
            a transaction are live from the standpoint of the querying methods on the object.<br/>
            	<br/>
            As an example, imagine that you have a FeatureSource that has 10 records in it.
            Next, you begin a transaction and then call GetAllFeatures.  The result would be 10
            records. After that, you call a delete on one of the records and call the GetAllFeatures
            again.  This time you only get nine records, even though the
            transaction has not yet been committed. In the same sense, you could have added a new
            record or modified an existing one and those changes would be considered live, though not
            committed.<br/>
            	<br/>
            In the case where you modify records -- such as expanding the size of a polygon -- those
            changes are reflected as well. For example, you expand a polygon by doubling its size
            and then do a spatial query that would not normally return the smaller record, but instead
            would return the larger records.  In this case, the larger records are returned. You can set this
            property to be false, as well; in which case, all of the spatially related methods would
            ignore anything that is currently in the transaction buffer waiting to be committed. In
            such a case, only after committing the transaction would the FeatureSource reflect the
            changes.

                For developers who are creating or extending a FeatureSource, it is expected that

            By default this property is null, meaning that the data being passed back from any
            methods on the FeatureSource will be in the coordinate system of the raw data. When you
            specify a projection object in the property, all incoming and outgoing method
            calls will subject the features to projection.<br/>
            	<br/>
            For example, if the spatial database you are using has all of its data stored in decimal
            degrees, but you want to see the data in UTM, you would create a projection object
            that goes from decimal degrees to UTM and set that as the projection. With this one
            property set, we will ensure that it will seem to you the developer that all of the data
            in the FeatureSource is in UTM. That means every spatial query will return UTM projected
            shapes. You can even pass in UTM shapes for the parameters. Internally, we will ensure
            that the shapes are converted to and from the projection without any intervention
            on the developer's part.<br/>
            	<br/>
            In fact, even when you override virtual or abstract core methods in the FeatureSource,
            you will not need to know about projections at all. Simply work with the data in its
            native coordinate system. We will handle all of the projection at the high level
            method.

            This string collection is a handy place to specify what records not to get from the source.
            Suppose you have a shape file of roads and you want to hide the roads within a particular

            	<br/>
            The Transaction System<br/>
            	<br/>
            The transaction system of a FeatureSource sits on top of the inherited implementation
            of any specific source, such as Oracle Spatial or Shape files. In this way, it functions
            the same way for every FeatureSource. You start by calling BeginTransaction. This
            allocates a collection of in-memory change buffers that are used to store changes until
            you commit the transaction. So, for example, when you call the Add, Delete or Update
            method, the changes to the feature are stored in memory only. If for any reason you
            choose to abandon the transaction, you can call RollbackTransaction at any time and the
            in-memory buffer will be deleted and the changes will be lost. When you are ready to
            commit the transaction, you call CommitTransaction and the collections of changes
            are then passed to the CommitTransactionCore method and the implementer of the specific
            FeatureSource is responsible for integrating your changes into the underlying
            FeatureSource. By default the IsLiveTransaction property is set to false, which means
            that until you commit the changes, the FeatureSource API will not reflect any changes
            that are in the temporary editing buffer.<br/>
            	<br/>
            In the case where the IsLiveTransaction is set to true, then things function slightly
            differently. The live transaction concept means that all of the modifications you
            perform during a transaction are live from the standpoint of the querying methods on
            the object.<br/>
            	<br/>
            As an example, imagine that you have a FeatureSource that has 10 records in it.
            Next, you begin a transaction and then call GetAllFeatures.  The result would be 10
            records. After that, you call a delete on one of the records and call the GetAllFeatures
            again.  This time you only get nine records, even though the
            transaction has not yet been committed. In the same sense, you could have added a new
            record or modified an existing one and those changes would be considered live, though not
            committed.<br/>
            	<br/>
            In the case where you modify records -- such as expanding the size of a polygon -- those
            changes are reflected as well. For example, you expand a polygon by doubling its size
            and then do a spatial query that would not normally return the smaller record, but instead
            would return the larger records.  In this case, the larger records are returned. You can set this
            property to be false, as well; in which case, all of the spatially related methods would
            ignore anything that is currently in the transaction buffer waiting to be committed. In
            such a case, only after committing the transaction would the FeatureSource reflect the
            changes.

            and cache the results. The next time this method is called it will not call
            GetColumnsCore again. This was done to increase speed, as this is a critical method that

            As this is the virtual core version of the Columns method, it is intended to

            this way, the FeatureSource will know what columns are available and will remove any
            extra columns when making calls to other core methods. For example, if you have a
            FeatureSource that has three columns of information and the user calls a method that
            requests four columns of information (something they can do with custom fields), we will
            first compare what they are asking for to the results of the GetColumnsCore. This

            If you override this method, it is recommended that you take the following things
            into account: This method may be called multiple times, so we suggest you write the method so
            that that a call to a closed FeatureSource is ignored and does not generate an error.
            We also suggest that in the Close you free all resources that have been opened.
            Remember that the object will not be destroyed, but will be re-opened possibly in the
            near future.

            <remarks>
            This method is used to start a transaction, assuming that the FeatureSource allows
            editing. There are some additional prerequisites to beginning a transaction, such as ensuring
            that a transaction is not already in progress. You must also be sure that the FeatureSource has
            been opened.<br/>

            The Transaction System<br/>
            	<br/>
            The transaction system of a FeatureSource sits on top of the inherited implementation
            of any specific source, such as Oracle Spatial or Shape files. In this way, it functions
            the same way for every FeatureSource. You start by calling BeginTransaction. This
            allocates a collection of in-memory change buffers that are used to store changes until
            you commit the transaction. So, for example, when you call the Add, Delete or Update
            method, the changes to the feature are stored in memory only. If for any reason you
            choose to abandon the transaction, you can call RollbackTransaction at any time and the
            in-memory buffer will be deleted and the changes will be lost. When you are ready to
            commit the transaction, you call CommitTransaction and the collections of changes
            are then passed to the CommitTransactionCore method and the implementer of the specific
            FeatureSource is responsible for integrating your changes into the underlying
            FeatureSource. By default the IsLiveTransaction property is set to false, which means
            that until you commit the changes, the FeatureSource API will not reflect any changes
            that are in the temporary editing buffer.<br/>
            	<br/>
            In the case where the IsLiveTransaction is set to true, then things function slightly
            differently. The live transaction concept means that all of the modifications you
            perform during a transaction are live from the standpoint of the querying methods on
            the object.<br/>
            	<br/>
            As an example, imagine that you have a FeatureSource that has 10 records in it.
            Next, you begin a transaction and then call GetAllFeatures.  The result would be 10
            records. After that, you call a delete on one of the records and call the GetAllFeatures
            again.  This time you only get nine records, even though the
            transaction has not yet been committed. In the same sense, you could have added a new
            record or modified an existing one and those changes would be considered live, though not
            committed.<br/>
            	<br/>
            In the case where you modify records -- such as expanding the size of a polygon -- those
            changes are reflected as well. For example, you expand a polygon by doubling its size
            and then do a spatial query that would not normally return the smaller record, but instead
            would return the larger records.  In this case, the larger records are returned. You can set this
            property to be false, as well; in which case, all of the spatially related methods would
            ignore anything that is currently in the transaction buffer waiting to be committed. In
            such a case, only after committing the transaction would the FeatureSource reflect the
            changes.

                loop through the transaction buffer and add, edit or delete the InternalFeatures in your
                underlying data source. Remember to build and pass back the TransactionResult class
                so that users of your FeatureSource can respond to failures you may encounter while
                committing the InternalFeatures. We will handle the end of the transaction and also the
                cleanup of the transaction buffer. Your task will be to commit the records and

            	would return the larger records.  In this case, the larger records are returned. You can set this
            	property to be false, as well; in which case, all of the spatially related methods would
            	ignore anything that is currently in the transaction buffer waiting to be committed. In

            The main purpose of this method is to be the anchor of all of our default virtual
            implementations within this class. We as the framework developers wanted to provide you
            the user with as much default virtual implementation as possible. To do this, we needed
            a way to get access to all of the features. For example, let's say we want to create a default
            implementation for finding all of the InternalFeatures in a bounding box. Because this is an
            abstract class, we do not know the specifics of the underlying data or how its spatial
            indexes work. What we do know is that if we get all of the records, then we can brute-force
            the answer. In this way, if you inherited from this class and only implemented this one
            method, we can provide default implementations for virtually every other API.<br/>
            	<br/>
            While this is nice for you the developer if you decide to create your own FeatureSource,
            it comes with a price: namely, it is very inefficient. In the example we just
            discussed (about finding all of the InternalFeatures in a bounding box), we would not want to look
            at every record to fulfil this method. Instead, we would want to override the
            GetFeaturesInsideBoundingBoxCore and implement specific code that would be faster. For
            example, in Oracle Spatial there is a specific SQL statement to perform this operation very
            quickly. The same holds true with other specific FeatureSource examples.<br/>
            	<br/>
            Most default implementations in the FeatureSource call the
            GetFeaturesInsideBoundingBoxCore, which by default calls the GetAllFeaturesCore. It is
            our advice that if you create your own FeatureSource that you ALWAYS override the
            GetFeatureInsideBoundingBox. This will ensure that nearly every other API will operate

            	<para>This method returns a user defined number of InternalFeatures that are closest to the
                TargetShape. It is important to note that the TargetShape and the FeatureSource must use
                the same unit, such as feet or meters. If they do not, then the results will not be
                predictable or correct. If there is a current transaction and it is marked as live,

                The implementation we provided creates a small bounding box around the TargetShape
                and then queries the features inside of it. If we reach the number of items to find,
                then we measure the returned InternalFeatures to find the nearest. If we do not find enough
                records, we scale up the bounding box and try again. As you can see, this is not the
                most efficient method. If your underlying data provider exposes a more efficient way,

            <remarks>
            This method returns a user defined number of InternalFeatures that are closest to the
            TargetShape. It is important to note that the TargetShape and the FeatureSource must use
            the same unit, such as feet or meters. If they do not, then the results will not be
            predictable or correct. If there is a current transaction and it is marked as live,
            then the results will include any transaction Feature that applies.<br/>
            <br/>
            The implementation we provided creates a small bounding box around the TargetShape
            and then queries the features inside of it. If we reach the number of items to find,
            then we measure the returned InternalFeatures to find the nearest. If we do not find enough
            records, we scale up the bounding box and try again. As you can see, this is not the
            most efficient method. If your underlying data provider exposes a more efficient way,
            we recommend you override the Core version of this method and implement it.<br/>
            <br/>
            The default implementation of GetFeaturesNearestCore uses the
            GetFeaturesInsideBoundingBoxCore method for speed. We strongly recommend that you
            provide your own implementation for this method that will be more efficient.
            When you override GetFeaturesInsideBoundingBoxCore method, we recommend that you use
            any spatial indexes you have at your disposal to make this method as fast as
            possible.

            </returns>
            <remarks>
            This method returns a collection of InternalFeatures that are within a certain
            distance of the TargetShape. It is important to note that the TargetShape and the
            FeatureSource must use the same unit, such as feet or meters. If they do not, then the
            results will not be predictable or correct. If there is a current transaction and
            it is marked as live, then the results will include any transaction Feature that
            applies.<br/>
            <br/>
            The implementation we provided creates a bounding box around the TargetShape using
            the distance supplied and then queries the features inside of it. This may not be the
            most efficient method for this operation. If your underlying data provider exposes a
            more efficient way, we recommend you override the Core version of this method and
            implement it.<br/>
            <br/>
            The default implementation of GetFeaturesWithinDistanceOfCore uses the
            GetFeaturesInsideBoundingBoxCore method for speed. We strongly recommend that you
            provide your own implementation for this method that will be more efficient. When
            you override GetFeaturesInsideBoundingBoxCore method, we recommend that you use
            any spatial indexes you have at your disposal to make this method as fast as
            possible.

            <remarks>
            	<para>This is a protected method that is intended to help developers who want to
                implement or extend one of our FeatureSources. It is important to note that, as a
                general rule, returning column data of a Feature or a set of InternalFeatures happens
                inside the non-Core methods and we usually take care of it. However, as a developer,
                if you wish to add a new public method, then you will need to handle the projection
                yourself.<br/>
            		<br/>
                Let's say, for example, that you want to add a new Find method called FindLargeFeatures.
                You pass in a group of columns to return. Most of the time, the requested columns will
                actually be in the FeatureSource, but sometimes they will not. The way we allow users to get
                data from outside of the Feature Source is by raising an event called
                CustomColumnFetch. This way, we allow people to provide data that is outside of the
                FeatureSource. Since you will be implementing your own public method, you will want
                to support this as all of our other public methods do.<br/>
            		<br/>
                When you first enter the public method, you will want to separate out the fields
                that are in the FeatureSource from those that are not. You can call this method and
                the GetColumnNamesOutsideFeatureSource. If inside your public method you need to
                call any of our Core methods, then you need to make sure that you only pass in the
                list of column names that are in the FeatureSource. We assume that Core methods are
                simple and they do not handle this complexity.<br/>
            		<br/>
                With the list of non-FeatureSource column names, you simply loop through each column
                name for each record and call the OnCustomColumnFetch method while passing in the proper
                parameters. This will allow you give the user a chance to provide the values for
                the Feature's fields that were not in the FeatureSource. After that, you combine
                your results and pass them back out as the return.<br/>

                // Step4: Integrate the custom data with the result of the Core method plus any

            	<para>This protected virtual method is called from the concrete public method
                GetFirstFeaturesWellKnownType. It does not take into account any transaction activity, as this is the
                responsibility of the concrete public method GetFirstFeaturesWellKnownType. This way, as a developer,
                if you choose to override this method you do not have to consider transactions at
                all.<br/>
            		<br/>
                The default implementation of GetCountCore uses the GetAllRFeaturesCore method to
                get WellKnownType of the first feature from all features. We strongly recommend
                that you provide your own implementation for this method that will be more
                efficient.<br/>
            		<br/>
                If you do not override this method, it will get the count by calling the
                GetAllFeaturesCore method and get WellKnownType of the first feature from all features. This is a very inefficient way
                to get the count in most data sources. It is highly recommended that you override
                this method and replace it with a highly optimized version. For example, in a
                ShapeFile the record count is in the main header of the file. Similarly, if you are
                using Oracle Spatial, you can execute a simple query to get the count of all of the
                records without returning them. In these ways you can greatly improve the
                performance of this method.</para>

            <remarks>
            This method returns a collection of InternalFeatures by providing a group of Ids. The
            internal implementation calls the GetAllFeaturesCore. Because of this, if you want a more
            efficient version of this method, then we highly suggest you override the
            GetFeaturesByIdsCore method and provide a fast way to find a group of InternalFeatures by their
            Id.

                general rule, returning column data of a Feature or a set of InternalFeatures happens
                inside the non-Core methods and we usually take care of it. However, as a developer,
                if you wish to add a new public method, then you will need to handle the projection
                yourself.<br/>
            		<br/>
                Let's say, for example, that you want to add a new Find method called FindLargeFeatures.
                You pass in a group of columns to return. Most of the time, the requested columns will
                actually be in the FeatureSource, but sometimes they will not. The way we allow users to get
                data from outside of the Feature Source is by raising an event called
                CustomColumnFetch. This way, we allow people to provide data that is outside of the
                FeatureSource. Since you will be implementing your own public method, you will want
                to support this as all of our other public methods do.<br/>
            		<br/>
                When you first enter the public method, you will want to separate out the fields
                that are in the FeatureSource from those that are not. You can call this method and
                the GetColumnNamesOutsideFeatureSource. If inside your public method you need to
                call any of our Core methods, then you need to make sure that you only pass in the
                list of column names that are in the FeatureSource. We assume that Core methods are
                simple and they do not handle this complexity.<br/>
            		<br/>
                With the list of non-FeatureSource column names, you simply loop through each column
                name for each record and call the OnCustomColumnFetch method while passing in the proper
                parameters. This will allow you give the user a chance to provide the values for
                the Feature's fields that were not in the FeatureSource. After that, you combine
                your results and pass them back out as the return.<br/>

            This method is meant to be used by advanced users who are creating their own new methods

            anywhere in the system to create a unique string. For example, let's say you have
            a dataset that has the following columns: Name, Grade and Class, and you want to
            create a custom label for it. Whenever you specify the column you wanted to use in the
            label, you could use a string like this: "[Name] received a [Grade] in [Class]" and
            this would be valid. Behind the scenes, this method parses the string and returns the
            column names separately. Then, after we have the data, there is another helper
            method called CombineFieldValues that will add them back together again.<br/>
            	<br/>
            All of this happens normally in the concrete methods of the FeatureSource and
            inheriting classes; however, if you want to extend the classes and create your own
            concrete methods, then we suggest you use this to be compliant with the concatenation
            system.

            <summary>This class is the base class for all types of Layers.</summary>
            <remarks>
            The Layer class is where all other types of layers are inherited from. It
            provides the base set of functionality. Though all Layers inherit from this class, we
            strongly suggest if you decide to create your own layer type that you consider
            inheriting from the higher level RasterLayer for image-based layers and FeatureLayer for
            feature-based layers. They provide a rich set of default operations for the various
            types of layers and are simple to inherit from.<br/>
            	<br/>
            As it is abstract, there are a number of methods you need to implement. The first is
            DrawCore. In this method, you are responsible for drawing the layer's representation.
            The other two required methods are OpenCore and CloseCore. These open and close the Layer. In
            the Open, you are responsible for getting the layer ready for drawing. You should open
            any file references, etc. In the Close, you need to clean up all file handles, close
            other objects etc. It is important that the Close puts the class in a state where it can
            be re-opened in the future. It is different than Dispose, as closed Layers will still
            exist and can be re-opened later in the mapping life cycle. Many methods (in the layer
            and in higher level objects) will require that the Layer be open before these methods
            are called, otherwise they will throw an exception.

            the developer to extend our logic to suit your needs. If you have questions about this,
            please contact our support team as we would be happy to work with you on extending our

            It is typical that the RasterSource may be opened and closed may times during the life
            cycle of your application. The type of control the MapEngine is embedded in will dictate
            how often this happens. For example, in the case of the Web Edition, each time
            a RasterSource is in the Ajax or Post Back part of the page cycle, it will close the
            RasterSource before returning back to the client. This is to conserve resources, as
            the web is a connection-less environment. In the case of the Desktop Edition, we can
            keep the RasterSource open, knowing that we can maintain a persistent connection.

            CustomColumnFetch Event Background<br/>
            	<br/>
            This event is used primarily when you have data relating to a particular feature or set of
            features that is not within source of the data. For example, you may have a shape file
            of the world whose .dbf component describes the area and population of each country.
            Additionally, in an outside SQL Server table, you may also have data about the countries,
            and it is this data that you wish to use for determining how you want to color
            each country.<br/>
            	<br/>
            To integrate this SQL data, you simply create a file name that does not exist in the
            .dbf file.  Whenever Map Suite is queried to return records that specifically require
            this field, the FeatureSource will raise this event and allow you the developer to
            supply the data. In this way, you can query the SQL table and store the
            data in some sort of collection, and then when the event is raised, simply supply that
            data.<br/>
            	<br/>
            As this is an event, it will raise for each feature and field combination requested.
            This means that the event can be raised quite often, and we suggest that you cache the
            data you wish to supply in memory. We recommend against sending out a new SQL query
            each time this event is raised. Image that you are supplementing two columns and your query
            returns 2,000 rows. This means that if you requested those fields, the event would be raised
            4,000 times.

            	<br/>
            Where possible we allow you to use stream in place of concreate files on the file
            system. This gives you the flexibility to retrieve data from isolated storage,
            encrypted files, compressed files, fast memory streams or any other stream origin. This
            is typically available where you would pass in a path and file name. Streams can be
            substituted in a number of places such as images, shape files etc. Below describes how
            the system works though specific places may have slightly different variations.<br/>
            	<br/>
             You will create the object that will use the stream normally such as a
            ShapeFielFeatureSource and then subscribe to the StreamLoading event. For these classes
            you typically need to supply a path and file name, while this is still required you can
            pass in a valid path that does not exist such as "Z:\ShapeFile1.shp". When we need the
            stream from you we will give you this string so you can find the associated stream. In
            essence you can use the path and file name as a key to kink to the source of your
            stream.<br/>
            	<br/>
             When we need the file we will raise the StreamLoading event and allow you to pass an
            alternate stream. In the StreamLoading event we provide you with the path and file name
            you used and we expect for you to create the stream and set it as the AlternatStream
            property along with setting the FileMode and File access appropriate to the stream.
            This helps us know our limits with the stream.

                The streamSource name just needs to be some unique string that will let the user
                know which file or stream you want. For example you could have a streamSourceName
                of "Z:\test.shp" and though the Z drive might not exist it might be a cue for you
                to load "test.shp" from isolated storage. We suggest you use a string that is in
                the file format of "?:\????.???" as this allows is to validate it though we do not
                check if it exists.<br/>

                Alternate Streams<br/>
            		<br/>
                Where possible we allow you to use stream in place of concreate files on the file
                system. This gives you the flexibility to retrieve data from isolated storage,
                encrypted files, compressed files, fast memory streams or any other stream origin.
                This is typically available where you would pass in a path and file name. Streams
                can be substituted in a number of places such as images, shape files etc. Below
                describes how the system works though specific places may have slightly different
                variations.<br/>
            		<br/>
                 You will create the object that will use the stream normally such as a
                ShapeFielFeatureSource and then subscribe to the StreamLoading event. For these
                classes you typically need to supply a path and file name, while this is still
                required you can pass in a valid path that does not exist such as
                "Z:\ShapeFile1.shp". When we need the stream from you we will give you this string
                so you can find the associated stream. In essence you can use the path and file
                name as a key to kink to the source of your stream.<br/>
            		<br/>
                 When we need the file we will raise the StreamLoading event and allow you to pass
                an alternate stream. In the StreamLoading event we provide you with the path and

            As an example, imagine that you have a FeatureLayer that has 10 records in it.

            records. After that, you call a delete on one of the records and call the GetAllFeatures

            The Transaction System<br/>
            	<br/>
            The transaction system of a FeatureLayer sits on top of the inherited implementation
            of any specific source, such as Oracle Spatial or Shape files. In this way, it functions
            the same way for every FeatureLayer. You start by calling BeginTransaction. This
            allocates a collection of in-memory change buffers that are used to store changes until
            you commit the transaction. So, for example, when you call the Add, Delete or Update
            method, the changes to the feature are stored in memory only. If for any reason you
            choose to abandon the transaction, you can call RollbackTransaction at any time and the
            in-memory buffer will be deleted and the changes will be lost. When you are ready to
            commit the transaction, you call CommitTransaction and the collections of changes
            are then passed to the CommitTransactionCore method and the implementer of the specific
            FeatureLayer is responsible for integrating your changes into the underlying
            FeatureLayer. By default the IsLiveTransaction property is set to false, which means
            that until you commit the changes, the FeatureLayer API will not reflect any changes
            that are in the temporary editing buffer.<br/>
            	<br/>
            In the case where the IsLiveTransaction is set to true, then things function slightly
            differently. The live transaction concept means that all of the modifications you
            perform during a transaction are live from the standpoint of the querying methods on
            the object.<br/>
            	<br/>

            The Transaction System<br/>
            	<br/>
            The transaction system of a FeatureLayer sits on top of the inherited implementation
            of any specific source, such as Oracle Spatial or Shape files. In this way, it functions
            the same way for every FeatureLayer. You start by calling BeginTransaction. This
            allocates a collection of in-memory change buffers that are used to store changes until
            you commit the transaction. So, for example, when you call the Add, Delete or Update
            method, the changes to the feature are stored in memory only. If for any reason you
            choose to abandon the transaction, you can call RollbackTransaction at any time and the
            in-memory buffer will be deleted and the changes will be lost. When you are ready to
            commit the transaction, you call CommitTransaction and the collections of changes
            are then passed to the CommitTransactionCore method and the implementer of the specific
            FeatureLayer is responsible for integrating your changes into the underlying
            FeatureLayer. By default the IsLiveTransaction property is set to false, which means
            that until you commit the changes, the FeatureLayer API will not reflect any changes
            that are in the temporary editing buffer.<br/>
            	<br/>
            In the case where the IsLiveTransaction is set to true, then things function slightly
            differently. The live transaction concept means that all of the modifications you
            perform during a transaction are live from the standpoint of the querying methods on
            the object.<br/>
            	<br/>
            As an example, imagine that you have a FeatureLayer that has 10 records in it.
            Next, you begin a transaction and then call GetAllFeatures.  The result would be 10
            records. After that, you call a delete on one of the records and call the GetAllFeatures
            again.  This time you only get nine records, even though the
            transaction has not yet been committed. In the same sense, you could have added a new
            record or modified an existing one and those changes would be considered live, though not
            committed.<br/>
            	<br/>
            In the case where you modify records -- such as expanding the size of a polygon -- those
            changes are reflected as well. For example, you expand a polygon by doubling its size

            This method deletes a Feature from an existing transaction. You will need to
            ensure that you have started a transaction by calling BeginTransaction.<br/>
            	<br/>
            The Transaction System<br/>
            	<br/>
            The transaction system of a FeatureLayer sits on top of the inherited implementation
            of any specific source, such as Oracle Spatial or Shape files. In this way, it functions
            the same way for every FeatureLayer. You start by calling BeginTransaction. This
            allocates a collection of in-memory change buffers that are used to store changes until
            you commit the transaction. So, for example, when you call the Add, Delete or Update
            method, the changes to the feature are stored in memory only. If for any reason you
            choose to abandon the transaction, you can call RollbackTransaction at any time and the
            in-memory buffer will be deleted and the changes will be lost. When you are ready to
            commit the transaction, you call CommitTransaction and the collections of changes
            are then passed to the CommitTransactionCore method and the implementer of the specific
            FeatureLayer is responsible for integrating your changes into the underlying
            FeatureLayer. By default the IsLiveTransaction property is set to false, which means
            that until you commit the changes, the FeatureLayer API will not reflect any changes
            that are in the temporary editing buffer.<br/>
            	<br/>
            In the case where the IsLiveTransaction is set to true, then things function slightly
            differently. The live transaction concept means that all of the modifications you
            perform during a transaction are live from the standpoint of the querying methods on
            the object.<br/>
            	<br/>
            As an example, imagine that you have a FeatureLayer that has 10 records in it.
            Next, you begin a transaction and then call GetAllFeatures.  The result would be 10
            records. After that, you call a delete on one of the records and call the GetAllFeatures
            again.  This time you only get nine records, even though the
            transaction has not yet been committed. In the same sense, you could have added a new
            record or modified an existing one and those changes would be considered live, though not
            committed.<br/>
            	<br/>
            In the case where you modify records -- such as expanding the size of a polygon -- those
            changes are reflected as well. For example, you expand a polygon by doubling its size
            and then do a spatial query that would not normally return the smaller record, but instead
            would return the larger records.  In this case, the larger records are returned. You can set this
            property to be false, as well; in which case, all of the spatially related methods would
            ignore anything that is currently in the transaction buffer waiting to be committed. In
            such a case, only after committing the transaction would the FeatureLayer reflect the
            changes.

            <remarks>
            The DrawingQuality enumeration allows you to control, in a macro sense, the drawing
            quality that will be used in the GeoCanvas. Each GeoCanvas, which is responsible for
            drawing of the features, may have its own specialized drawing quality properties. What the
            DrawingQuality enumeration does is define some general guidelines for each GeoCanvas.
            For example, if you set the DrawingQuality to HighSpeed, then inside of the
            PlatformGeoCanvas there is a profile for HighSpeed. This profile sets specific
            properties, such as the smoothing mode and composing drawing mode of the
            PlatformGeoCanvas. As each GeoCanvas may have different drawing quality properties, this
            offers a general way to control drawing quality and speed.<br/>
            	<br/>
            If you need complete control over how a specific GeoCanvas will draw, then you can
            set the DrawingQuality to Custom. This will tell the specific GeoCanvas to use the
            properties on its own object instead of one of the pre-defined profiles. If one of the
            profiles -- such as HighSpeed or HighQuality -- is set, then the specific GeoCanvas ignores its
            own properties for drawing quality.

            	<br/>
            If you override this method, it is recommended that you take the following things
            into account: This method may be called multiple times, so we suggest you write the method so
            that that a call to a closed FeatureLayer is ignored and does not generate an error.
            We also suggest that in the Close you free all resources that have been opened.
            Remember that the object will not be destroyed, but will be re-opened possibly in the
            near future.

            	This method returns a user defined number of InternalFeatures that are closest to the
                TargetShape. It is important to note that the TargetShape and the FeatureSource
                must use the same unit, such as feet or meters. If they do not, then the results will not be
                predictable or correct. If there is a current transaction and it is marked as live, then

                The implementation we provided create a small bounding box around the TargetShape

                then we measure the returned InternalFeatures to find the nearest. If we do not find enough
                records, we scale up the bounding box and try again. As you can see, this is not the
                most efficient method. If your underlying data provider exposes a more efficient way,

            	<para>This method returns a user defined number of InternalFeatures that are closest to the
                TargetShape. It is important to note that the TargetShape and the FeatureSource must use
                the same unit, such as feet or meters. If they do not, then the results will not be
                predictable or correct. If there is a current transaction and it is marked as live,
                then the results will include any transaction Feature that applies.<br/>
            		<br/>
                The implementation we provided creates a small bounding box around the TargetShape
                and then queries the features inside of it. If we reach the number of items to find,
                then we measure the returned InternalFeatures to find the nearest. If we do not find enough
                records, we scale up the bounding box and try again. As you can see, this is not the
                most efficient method. If your underlying data provider exposes a more efficient way,
                we recommend you override the Core version of this method and implement it.<br/>
            		<br/>
                The default implementation of GetFeaturesNearestCore uses the
                GetFeaturesInsideBoundingBoxCore method for speed. We strongly recommend that you
                provide your own implementation for this method that will be more efficient.
                When you override GetFeaturesInsideBoundingBoxCore method, we recommend that you use
                any spatial indexes you have at your disposal to make this method as fast as
                possible.<br/>

            The main purpose of this method is to be the anchor of all of our default virtual
            implementations within this class. We as the framework developers wanted to provide you
            the user with as much default virtual implementation as possible. To do this, we needed
            a way to get access to all of the features. For example, let's say we want to create a default
            implementation for finding all of the InternalFeatures in a bounding box. Because this is an
            abstract class, we do not know the specifics of the underlying data or how its spatial
            indexes work. What we do know is that if we get all of the records, then we can brute-force
            the answer. In this way, if you inherited from this class and only implemented this one
            method, we can provide default implementations for virtually every other API.<br/>
            	<br/>
            While this is nice for you the developer if you decide to create your own FeatureSource,
            it comes with a price: namely, it is very inefficient. In the example we just
            discussed (about finding all of the InternalFeatures in a bounding box), we would not want to look
            at every record to fulfil this method. Instead, we would want to override the
            GetFeaturesInsideBoundingBoxCore and implement specific code that would be faster. For
            example, in Oracle Spatial there is a specific SQL statement to perform this operation very
            quickly. The same holds true with other specific FeatureSource examples.<br/>
            	<br/>
            Most default implementations in the FeatureSource call the
            GetFeaturesInsideBoundingBoxCore, which by default calls the GetAllFeaturesCore. It is
            our advice that if you create your own FeatureSource that you ALWAYS override the
            GetFeatureInsideBoundingBox. This will ensure that nearly every other API will operate

            Below the lower threshold in scale, the image will not be displayed. This, in
            conjunction with the UpperThreshold property, allows you to create a band in which it is
            suitable to display the image source. By default, the upper threshold is double.max and
            lower threshold is double.min. This means the image should always display.

            The open method plays an important rol,e as it is responsible for initializing the

            the RasterLayer is not opened. When the map draws each layer, it will open the
            RasterLayer as one of its first steps; then, after it is finished drawing with that
            layer, it will close it. In this way, we are sure to release all resources used by the
            RasterLayer.

            <remarks>
            The close method plays an important role in the life cycle of the RasterLayer. It may
            be called after drawing to release any memory and other resources that were allocated
            since the Open method was called.<br/>
            	<br/>
            If you override this method, it is recommended that you take the following things
            into account: This method may be called multiple times, so we suggest you write the method so
            that that a call to a closed RasterLayer is ignored and does not generate an error.
            We also suggest that in the Close you free all resources that have been opened.
            Remember that the object will not be destroyed, but will be re-opened possibly in the
            near future.

            The scale is the ratio of a single unit of distance on the map to the equivalent
            distance on the ground. For example, a scale of 1:1 means that one foot on the ground
            would be displayed as one foot on the screen. A scale of 1:1,000 means that one foot on
            the screen is equal to 1,000 feet on the ground.

            a certain column value is over 100, then you need to be sure you include the column
            name. This will ensure that the column data is returned to you in the feature when it
            is ready to draw.<br/>
            	<br/>
            In many of the styles, we add properties to allow the user to specify which field they
            need; then, in the GetRequiredColumnNamesCore, we read that property and add it to the
            collection.

            	<para>This protected virtual method is called from the concreate public method
                GetCount. It does not take into account any transaction activity as this is the

                if you choose to override this method you do not have to consider transaction at
                all.<br/>
            		<br/>
                The default implementation of GetCountCore uses the GetAllRecordsCore method to
                calculate how many records there are in the FeatureSource. We strongly recommend
                that you provide your own implementation for this method that will be more
                efficient<br/>
            		<br/>
                If you do not override this method the means it gets the count is by calling the
                GetAllFeatureCore method and counting each feature. This is a very inefficient way
                to get the count in most data sources. It is highly recommended that you override
                this method and replace it with a highly optimized version. For example in a
                ShapeFile the record count is in the main header of the file. Similarly if you are
                using Oracle Spatial you can execute a simple query to get the count of all of the
                record without returning them. In these ways you can greatly improve the

                received. If you are implementing your own FeatureSource then this is one of the
                crucial methods you must create. It should be fairly straight forward that you will
                loop through the transaction buffer and add, edit or delete the InternalFeatures in your
                underlying data source. Remember to build and pass back the TransactionResult class
                so that users of your FeatureSource can respond to failures you may encounter
                committing the InternalFeatures. We will handle the end of the transaction and also the
                cleanup of the transaction buffer. Your task will be to commit the records and
                produce a TransactionResult return.</para>
            	<para>The Transaction System</para>
            	<para>The transaction system of a FeatureSource sits on top of the inherited
                implementation of any specific source such as Oracle Spatial or Shape files. In
                this way it functions the same way for every FeatureSource. You start by calling
                the BeginTransaction. This allocates a collection of in memory change buffers that
                are used to store changes until you commit the transaction. So for example when you
                call the Add, Delete or Update method the changes to the feature are stored in
                memory only. If for any reason you choose to abandon the transaction you can call
                RollbackTransaction at any time and the in memory buffer will be deleted and the
                changes will be lost. When you are ready to commit the transaction you call the
                CommitTransaction and the collections of changes are then passed to the
                CommitTransactionCore method and the implementer of the specific FeatureSource is
                responsible for integrating your changes into the underlying FeatureSource. By
                default the IsLiveTransaction property is set to false which means that until you
                commit the changes the FeatureSource API will not reflect any changes that are in
                the temporary editing buffer.</para>
            	<para>In the case where the IsLiveTransaction is set to true then things function
                slightly differently. The live transaction concept means that all of the
                modification you perform during a transaction are live from the standpoint of the
                querying methods on the object.</para>
            	<para>To setup an example imagine that you have a FeatureSource that has 10 records
                in it. Next you begin a transaction and then call GetAllFeatures, the result would
                be 10 records. After that you call a delete on one of the records and call the
                GetAllFeatures again, this time you only get nine records. You receive nine records
                even though the transaction has not yet been committed. In the same sense you could
                have added a new record or modified an existing one and those changes are
                considered live though not committed.</para>
            	<para>In the case where you modify records such as expanding the size of a polygon
                those changes as well are reflected. So for example you expand a polygon by
                doubling its size and then do a spatial query that would not normally return the
                smaller record but would return the larger records, in this case the larger record
                is returned. You can set this property to be false as well in which case all of the
                spatial related methods would ignore anything that is currently in the transaction
                buffer waiting to be committed. In this case only after committing the transaction
                would the FeatureSource reflect the changes.</para>

            The main purpose of this method is to be the anchor of all of our default virtual
            implementations within this class. We wanted as the framework developers to provide you
            the user with as much default virtual implementation as possible. To do this we needed
            a way to get access to all of the features. For example, we want to create a default
            implementation for finding all of the InternalFeatures in a bounding box. Because this is an
            abstract class we do not know the specifics of the underlying data or how its spatial
            indexes work. What we do know is that if we get all the records then we can brute force
            the answer. In this way if you inherited form this class and only implemented this one
            method we can provide default implementations for virtually every other API.<br/>
            	<br/>
            While this is nice for you the developer if you decide to create your own FeatureSource
            it comes with a price. The price is that it is very inefficient. In the case we just
            discussed about finding all of the InternalFeatures in a bounding box we would not want to look
            at every record to fulfil this method. Instead we would want to override the
            GetFeaturesInsideBoundingBoxCore and implement specific code that would be fast. For
            example in Oracle Spatial there is a specific SQL statement to do this operation very
            quickly. The same holds true with other specific FeatureSource examples.<br/>
            	<br/>
            Most default implementations in the FeatureSource call the
            GetFeaturesInsideBoundingBoxCore which by default calls the GetAllFeaturesCore. It is
            our advice that if you create your own FeatureSource that you ALWAYS override the
            GetFeatureInsideBoundingBox. It will ensure that nearly every other API will operate
            efficiently. Please see the specific API to determine what method it uses.

            methods. For example if you have a FeatureSource that has three columns of information
            and the user calls a method and requests four columns of information, something they
            can do with custom fields, we will first compare what they are asking for to the

                <br/>
                Compositing is done during rendering when the source pixels are
                combined with the destination pixels to produce the resultant pixels. The quality
                of compositing directly relates to the visual quality of the output and is
                inversely proportional to the render time. The higher the quality, the slower the
                render time. This is because the higher the quality level, the more surrounding
                pixels need to be taken into account during the composite. The linear quality
                setting (AssumeLinear) compromises by providing better quality than the default
                quality at a slightly lower speed.</para>

            It is faster to provide a native image object to the canvas for drawing. In some

            create the native image object, you should first create a GeoImage and then call this
            method and it will pass back the native image object. You can then use it to get

            This enumeration is used to control the drawing level. If you draw an item on the first
            level and another item on the second level, the second level item will occlude the first. In this way,
            you can layer various drawing symbols to get unique effects. For example, you can create
            a road by first drawing a wide black line on level one, followed by a thinner white line on
            level two. The white line will draw on top of the black line and create the illusion
            of an outlined road. Adding a centered dashed line on level three will create a
            centerline.

            <summary>This enumeration determines whether the brush or the pen draws first.</summary>
            <remarks>
            This controls if the outline pen or the fill brush will draw first. The
            difference in drawing is subtle, but noticeable. If you draw the outline first and then the brush, the
            brush fill will slightly bleed into the outline and make the outline appear thinner.  If you draw
            the brush first, then the pen will display its normal outline width.

            <remarks>
            The geography unit defines how your map data is stored. More specifically, it
            describes what the change in X and Y mean in relationship to the data itself. For
            example, if your data is stored in a geographic unit of feet, an increase of one
            on the x-axis means that you've moved one foot in the X direction. Nearly all map data is
            stored using three simple units, which are decimal degrees, feet, and meters. It is
            important to note that this has very little to do with the projection that the data is
            in.

            This method is useful when you want to create a perimeter around the shape. For
            example, if you had a MultiPolygon that represented buildings on a campus, you could
            easily get the convex hull of the buildings and determine the perimeter of all of the
            buildings together. This also works with MultiPoint shapes, where each point may
            represent a certain type of person you are doing statistics on. With convex hull, you
            can get an idea of the regions those points are located in.

            	<para>This method moves a base shape from one location to another based on an X
                and Y offset distance. With this overload, it is important to note that the X and Y
                offset units are based on the distanceUnit parameter. For example, if your shape
                is in decimal degrees and you call this method with an X offset of 1 and a Y
                offset of 1, you're going to move this shape one unit of the distanceUnit in
                the horizontal direction and one unit of the distanceUnit in the vertical
                direction. In this way, you can easily move a shape in decimal degrees five miles
                on the X axis and 3 miles on the Y axis.<br/>

            as point A of line two, and point B of line one shares the same vertex as point C of
            line two. They are both straight lines, so point B of line two would lie on the first
            line. Essentially the two lines are the same, with line 2 having just one extra point.
            Topologically they are the same line, so this method would return true.<br/>

                want to know the area in square miles. This is easy to accomplish. Simply call the GetArea
                method on the PolygonShape, passing in the first parameter of decimal degrees (which
                defines what unit the shape is in), and then square miles as the area unit you would

            <remarks>
            Length units are most commonly used when calling APIs that measure lengths.
            Regardless of the unit of measure your shapes are in, many of our APIs allow you to
            specify what unit of measure you want the result of the method call to be in. For
            example, you may have a LineShape whose points are in decimal degrees; however, you want
            to know the length in miles. This is easy to accomplish. Simply call the GetLength method on the
            LineShape, passing in the first parameter of decimal degrees (which defines what unit
            the shape is in), and then miles as the length unit you would like the result to be in.

            This method is used primarily to ensure that a Feature is valid. The reason is,
            since this is a structure, we cannot control the main constructor that allows you
            to create a Feature in an invalid state -- that state being one with no well-known binary at
            its core. If you use the constructure set provided, then the state should always be
            valid. This is a property you may want to check before you work with a Feature.

            </returns>
            <remarks>
            Topologically equal means that the shapes are essentially the same. For example,
            let's say you have a line with two points, point A and point B. You also have another line that
            is made up of point A, point B and point C. Point A of line one shares the same vertex
            as point A of line two, and point B of line one shares the same vertex as point C of
            line two. They are both straight lines, so point B of line two would lie on the first
            line. Essentially the two lines are the same, with line 2 having just one extra point.
            Topologically they are the same line, so this method would return true.<br/>

            This method is useful when you want to create a perimeter around the shape. For

            easily get the convex hull of the buildings and determine the perimeter of all of the
            buildings together. This also works with MultiPoint shapes, where each point may
            represent a certain type of person you are doing statistics on. With convex hull, you
            can get an idea of the regions those points are located in.

            	<para>This method returns a string that represents the shape in well-known text.
                Well-known text allows you to describe a geometry as a string of text. Well-known
                text is useful when you want to save a geometry in a format such as a text file, or when you
                simply want to cut and paste the text between other applications. An alternative
                to well-known text is well-known binary, which is a binary representation of a
                geometry object. We have methods that work with well-known binary as well.
                Below are some samples of what well-known text might look like for various kinds of
                geometric figures.</para>

            We use this method, with the simple enumeration, internally before doing any kind
            of other methods on the shape. In this way, we are able to verify the integrity of the
            shape itself. If you wish to test things such as whether a polygon self-intersects, we invite
            you to call this method with the advanced ShapeValidationMode. One thing to consider is
            that for complex polygon shapes this operation could take some time, which is why we
            only run the basic, faster test. If you are dealing with polygon shapes that are
            suspect, we suggest you run the advanced test.

            This method returns a byte array that represents the shape in well-known binary.
            Well-known binary allows you to describe a geometry as a binary array. Well-known
            binary is useful when you want to save a geometry in an efficient format using as little
            space as possible. An alternative to well-known binary is well-known text, which is a
            textual representation of a geometry object. We have methods that work with well-known

                is in decimal degrees and you call this method with an X offset of 1 and a Y
                offset of 1, you're going to move this shape 1 unit of the distanceUnit in
                the horizontal direction and one unit of the distanceUnit in the vertical
                direction. In this way, you can easily move a shape in decimal degrees five miles to
                on the X axis and 3 miles on the Y axis.</para>

                Well-known text allows you to describe a geometry as a string of text. Well-known

                geometry object. We have methods that work with well-known binary as well.

            you to call this method with the advanced ShapeValidationMode. One thing to consider is
            that for complex polygon shapes this operation could take some time, which is why we
            only run the basic, faster test. If you are dealing with polygon shapes that are
            suspect, we suggest you run the advanced test.

            projection. Though it uses its own format many organizations have recognized it and
            provide their projection definition in this format. Within this class we support the
            latest EPSG (European Petroleum Survey Group) SRID (Spatial Reference System
            Identifiers) list. You can find more information about these on the web. The SRID list
            is very popular and we include a text version with in our install.<br/>
            	<br/>
            Note that one thing that confuses people is that when they go to or from latitude and
            longitude they do not know what SRID to use. The proper SRID is 4326 for WGS84 pair
            coordinates in degrees with Greenwich as the central meridian.

            This method returns the point of the current shape that is closest to the target shape.
            It is often the case that the point returned is not a point of the object itself. An
            example would be a line with two points that are far apart from each other. If you set the
            targetShape to be a point midway between the points but a short distance away from the line, the
            method would return a point that is on the line but not either of the two points that make up the
            line.

            that for complex polygon shapes this operation could take some time, which is why we
            only run the basic, faster test. If you are dealing with polygon shapes that are
            suspect, we suggest you run the advanced test.

            	<para>This method returns a string that represents the shape in well-known text.
                Well-known text allows you to describe a geometry as a string of text. Well-known
                text is useful when you want to save a geometry in a format such as a text file, or when you
                simply want to cut and paste the text between other applications. An alternative
                to well-known text is well-known binary, which is a binary representation of a
                geometry object. We have methods that work with well-known binary as well.
                Below are some samples of what well-known text might look like for various kinds of

            shape itself. If you wish to test things such as whether a polygon self-intersects, we invite
            you to call this method with the advanced ShapeValidationMode. One thing to consider is
            that for complex polygon shapes this operation could take some time, which is why we
            only run the basic, faster test. If you are dealing with polygon shapes that are
            suspect, we suggest you run the advanced test.

            This function is used because the extent to draw must be the rame ratio as the screen
            width and height. If they are not, then the image drawn will be stretched or compressed.
            We always adjust the extent upwards to ensure that no matter how we adjust it,
            the original extent will fit within the new extent. This ensures that everything
            you wanted to see in the first extent is visible and maybe a bit more.

            Simplifies a point, ensuring that the result is a valid point having the same dimension and number of components as the input. The simplification uses a maximum distance difference algorithm similar to the one used in the Douglas-Peucker algorithm. In particular, if the input is an areal point ( Polygon or MultiPolygon ) The result has the same number of shells and holes (rings) as the input, in the same order The result rings touch at no more than the number of touching point in the input (although they may touch at fewer points).

            Simplifies a Geometry using the standard Douglas-Peucker algorithm. Ensures that any polygonal geometries returned are valid. Simple lines are not guaranteed to remain simple after simplification. Note that in general D-P does not preserve topology - e.g. polygons can be split, collapse to lines or disappear holes can be created or disappear, and lines can cross. To simplify point while preserving topology use TopologySafeSimplifier. (However, using D-P is significantly faster).

            This overridden method is called from the concrete public method Draw. In this
            method, we take the features you passed in and draw them on the canvas you provided.
            Each style (based on its properties) may draw each feature differently.<br/>
            	<br/>

            When overriding this method, consider each feature and its column data values. You can
            use the full power of the GeoCanvas to do the drawing. If you need column data for a
            feature, be sure to override the GetRequiredColumnNamesCore and add the columns you need
            to the collection. In many of the styles, we add properties to allow the user to specify
            which field they need; then, in the GetRequiredColumnNamesCore, we read that property and
            add it to the collection.

            Duplicate refers to the condition where a label's text is exactly the same as another label.

            In such a case, you do not want to label each segment as it would be highly redundant.

            This class is commonly used to draw lines on the GeoCanvas. It is specialized for

            outer and center pen to give you a nice effect. The outer pen draws first, and should
            typically be black and larger then the inner pen. The inner pen draws next, and should
            be set as the color of the road you want. It should be thinner than the outer pen. The
            center pen draws last, and is used to represent a centerline in the road. We suggest that you
            only use the center pen for highways at low zoom level, as the dashed pen has some performance
            penalties.

            <remarks>
            You can set an inner,
            outer and center pen to give you a nice effect. The outer pen draws first, and should
            typically be black and larger then the inner pen. The inner pen draws next, and should
            be set as the color of the road you want. It should be thinner than the outer pen. The
            center pen draws last, and is used to represent a centerline in the road. We suggest that you
            only use the center pen for highways at low zoom level, as the dashed pen has some performance
            penalties.

            This overridden method is called from the concrete public method Draw. In this
            method, we take the features you passed in and draw them on the canvas you provided.
            Each style (based on its properties) may draw each feature differently.<br/>
            	<br/>
            	<br/>
            When overriding this method, consider each feature and its column data values. You can
            use the full power of the GeoCanvas to do the drawing. If you need column data for a
            feature, be sure to override the GetRequiredColumnNamesCore and add the columns you need
            to the collection. In many of the styles, we add properties to allow the user to specify
            which field they need; then, in the GetRequiredColumnNamesCore, we read that property and
            add it to the collection.

            <summary>This class allows you to define how points are drawn on the canvas.</summary>
            <remarks>
            This class allows you to define how points are drawn on the canvas. There are
            three main drawing types: bitmap, character, and symbol. The bitmap allows you to
            represent each point with a bitmap. The character allows you to choose a font and an
            index in the font so you can use that character for the point. This is especially helpful
            with fonts like Wingdings that have many feature-style graphics. The symbol type is a
            collection of simple geometric symbols that we have assembled to represent abstract
            items on the map.<br/>
            	<br/>
            When you select a PointType, you need to be sure to set the various properties
            associated with that type. The property names are prefixed to help you. For example, all
            of the character-related properties are prefixed with "Character" and the symbol properties
            follow a similar pattern.

            <strong>GeoLineStyle</strong>, and <strong>GeoPointStyle</strong>.
            <strong>GeoAreaStyle</strong> is used to render area-type data on the map,
            <strong>GeoLineStyle</strong> is used to render line-type data on the map,
            <strong>GeoPointStyle</strong> is used to render point-type data on the map.

            The grid size determines how many labels will be considered as candidates for drawing. The

            There are three ways to handle duplicate label names. The first is to suppress
            all duplicates, which means if there are two street segments with the same name then
            only one will be drawn. The second way is to suppress duplicate labels only if they are
            in one quarter of the screen. In this way, the screen will be divided into four
            quadrants, and if the two duplicate labels are in different quadrants, then they will both
            draw. The last way is to draw all duplicates.

            This allows you to suppress labels where the label length would greatly exceed

            concern, then you can try the BestPlacement property. That property overrides this
            property and tries to fit the label in the best location so that the minimum number of
            labels are suppressed due to overlapping issues.

            When overriding this method, consider each feature and its column data values. You can

            feature, be sure to override the GetRequiredColumnNamesCore and add the columns you need
            to the collection. In many of the styles, we add properties to allow the user to specify
            which field they need; then, in the GetRequiredColumnNamesCore, we read that property and
            add it to the collection.

            The text style is used for labeling things on the map. There are a great number

            color and look of the text, and the TextColumnName you want to use for the text to
            draw. Each of the additional properties can be reviewed in the help or samples.
