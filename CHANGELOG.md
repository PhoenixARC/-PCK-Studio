 - Fixed several incorrect internal names for the change tile list for the following tiles: Crafting Table (front), Crafting Table (side), Torch, Stem, Repeater, Powered Rail, All of the Stained Glass Panes, Allium, Chorus Plant, Double Tall Seagrass, Repeater (Item), Written Book, Flower Pot (Item), Dark Oak Door (Item), Jungle Door (Item)

 - LOC Editor swapped to UTF-8
 - fixed bug dealing with Drag-and-drop
 - Added animation editor
 - "Move Up" and "Move Down" functions finally work properly and with folders!
 - Animation Editor can import Java block and item animations
 - Animation Editor has a built-in Change Tile function where every single block and item that can be animated is listed (clock and compass are excluded since they have animations based on game data).
